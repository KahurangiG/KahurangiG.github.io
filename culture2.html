    <h3>What skills (non-technical - human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at EDA?</h3>  
     <p>The ability to understand the flow of change within the tech industry. How does everything work together to make up what it means to be a part of an ever evolving industry.
     </p> 
     <h3>A description of your own strengths and limitations</h3>
     <p>  
        Strengths
        My trust in the process. I believe that everything comes in due time if you trust in the process that has been laid out. 
        My confidence to understand myself in knowing what works best for me to retain information in the best way.
        Limitations
        My lack of confidence in my sense of patience and competitive nature. Controlling my emotions in a productive way will be key.
         
     </p> 
    
     <h3>Based on the above description, a commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include - an explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, facilitators and industry/community representatives.</h3>
 
     <p>  
        I believe that most positive things in life deserve 100% attention when the time is set aside. This is what will be required for this course. 100% attention during the designated timeframe of each day.
     </p>
     <h3> 
        A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way.
        </h3>
     <p>   
        Two methods.
        Step one; to access online resources. The act of searching is all valuable with a reasonable amount of time. 
        Step two; to consult the team or facilitator directly about the matter.
        
    </p>
    <h3>A description of what you expect from the facilitation team</h3>
    <p>    
        Guidance, understanding and mutual respect
    </p>
    <h3>Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whanau commitments such as school drop-offs. Itâ€™s important to plan these in.</h3>
