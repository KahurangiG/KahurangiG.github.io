    <h2>A letter to my daughter</h2>   
    
    <div class="intro">

    <p>
        The 13th of August 2019 was the single most significant day of my life.
        This was the day that my values in life became crytal clear, my daughter came into the world and just like that I became a protector, 
        guider, provider, carer and a person with one with a massive sense of vulnerability followed closely by responsibility. I'm pretty 
        sure its a strange sensation shared by most parents. 
     <p>   
        I was soon to learn that every single incident in my life leading up to this moment was about to play a role in how I was going to
        teach this little human what it means to live on this earth. 
        It was time to drop some knowledge bombs every second of the day so here's what I've learnt so far about myself.
     </p> 
     <p>  
        But before this let me address this I thought why not just write this particular blog as a letter to my poutokomanawa. 
     </p> 
     
    </div>


     <span class="letter">
     <p>  
        Kia ora taku tau, 
     </p> 
     <p>  
        It should come as no surprise that you are both the apitimy of everything that your mama could ever care about however their are
        some crucial values that I hope that you will learn from me. 
     </p>
     <p>   
        Number one; Embrace your identity for it is the foundation of your belonging in this world. 
        As a Maori we walk this earth not just as ourselves but as an embodiment of our ancestors 
        who walked before us and our decendants that will walk this earth long after we are gone. We are here for a period of time 
        as a guardian of our heritage and of the land or Taiao. Your place of belonging is wherever you are because you are forever walking
        amongest your ancestors, it is what you do with your time that will be what matters. 
    </p>
    <p>    
        Remember the importance of keeping your Whare Tapa-wha balanced and in good health. The taiao (environment) will help you with this 
        especially if you help it as well. 
        Whare Tapa-wha
        {The four cornerstones of life.):
        Taha-tinana (physical side), Taha-hinengaro (mental side), Taha-Wairua (Spiritual side)
        Taha-Whanau (family side).
    </p>
    <p>     
        Never forget this especially in times of difficulty.
        Your mother was confronted with a number of incidences that challenged her sence of identity tempted by the 
        pressure to adapt to the modern, urban environment and conform and dismiss of so called 'cultural nonsense'.
        I did fall for this on a number of occasions. That Whare Tapa-wha suffered for it. When you spirit takes a beating no matter how
        good everything else in life is it wont feel whole. Balance and respecting each part of life is key. 
    </p>
    <p>    
        Moving on its important to learn the art of listening and absorbing, theirs always a time for everything. Your mum has been told
        that shes not to bad at this. You'll learn the most from others no matter who they are. 
    </p>
    <p>      
        What your mum isn't too good at is trusting in time. Sometimes somethings will take longer for you to understand then others, or 
        sometimes you wont get it the first time or the second time or the third time even but it will always be worth doing it another time. 
        Patience is such a valuable skill that I am yet to master. 
    </p>
    <p>     
        I have learnt to trust in processes during my time. With a background in design I've always respected the art of moving through
        specific stages of a process knowing that an outcome will always come out at the end. This is both a strength and limitation. 
        You see each journey is unique and not everyone will require the exact same process. Adaption is key as well. Processes are there 
        to guide and manage a journey, the rest I think is you.  
    </p>
    <p>      
        I've often worked along side people who by nature work to their own personal process that doesn't take into account any other alternative
        options. These are usually people that thrive on working alone or in a 'dictatorship' role. Its always best to understand eachothers
        strengths and weaknesses. It comes back to being a listener at first, this is crucial with then understanding the best form of communication
        with these people. Their are limitless different ways of communicating effectively its just a matter of finding the right fit. 
        This takes time.    
    </p>
    <p>      
        With all that said. Most importantly life is a journey filled with daily lessons to learn so never stop learning.

        Aroha nui 
        Mama...
