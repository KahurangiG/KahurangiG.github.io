<h1>Emotional Intellegence</h1>
<h2>Sprint3 Cultural Blog</h2>

<h3>Connection...</h3>
<p>
When I think of emotional intellegence the word connection comes to mind. A connection with the self, surroundings and the energy of those around us. 
Recognising the self is at the core of how everything is perceived and understanding that the condition of ones body, mind and spirit will always dictate how everything
is felt is key to understanding what truly dictates your reactions. Connecting with another is about truly finding yourself in there space as they communicate with you. 
I think of this in particular when connecting with a three year old. Connecting with a three year old is all about placing yourself in there world and completely 
emercing yourself in the level of comprehension. Just you and that little one in a world of adventure. When relating this to a conversation with an adult it is much 
similar I believe. Emercing yourself in that moment with another and connecting with not just words said but all forms of communication.
