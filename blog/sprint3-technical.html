<h1>Javascript & The Dom</h1>
<h2>Sprint3 Technical Blog</h2>

<h3>JavaScript and its relationship to HTML and CSS</h3>
<p>
We start all web applications with a skeleton of information. This is otherwise known as the HTML information. It is the blue prints to a building. Without it their
is nothing to be built on. The CSS is the meat to the bones. It is all about adding the walls to the blueprints, the structure that gives the building its integrity. 
Now Javascript is about applying the life to the build. It is the michanical garage door, the surround sound system, all the cool things that take the build from 
a average home to a high tech above avaerage home.

<h3>Explain control flow and loops</h3>
<p>
Control Flow is a way in which Javascript identify's relevant or non-relevant code. It is used to manage what information is to be read and translated and what shouldn't be. 
This is turn is a way on controling the flow of information. 
'If' statements and 'Else' statements are used to determine the relevance/non-relevance of a code.   
A loop is a set of codes that are put together to create a reoccuring sequence of motion until the variable is no longer relevant and can therefore move forward. 
A loop is found within the Control Flow. 

If we think about a day within the changing seasons of the year based around its relation to the sun. The day is the variable. In order to find out how long the day
is on a set day during the year we would determine this by a sequence of code that dictates how far that position is from the sun therefore finding out how long it
would be it is in day light. 

</p>

<h3>What is the DOM?</h3>
<p>The DOM or Document Object Model, is tool that goes hand in hand with Javascript. It holds information composed by the HTML and CSS documents. 
    It lists a number of nodes that are elements or objects defined by the HTML document. E.g a heading. 

    With this map of information you are then able to apply Javascript information to create interactive qualities.

<h3>Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and objects.</h3>
<p>
    Both Array and Objects are a list of multiple elements that make up a code. 
    The key difference between the two is the index order of the elements. 
    Arrays are listed in a 0 < sequence whereas an object is not confined to this, objects are usually a list of multiple different elements e.g string, variable etc.. Using an Array can be necessary when working through numbers in a specific
    order is crucial to the outcome.
</p>

<h3>Explain what functions are and why they are useful.</h3>

<p> Functions are a key set of code that activates an action. These codes once named are reusable throughout the DOM and therefore easily accessable throuhgout 
    the document. Functions are made up of a series of statements that are listed so that to produce a value. Functions are hugely useful in providing a calculated
    response to a series of designated variables.
