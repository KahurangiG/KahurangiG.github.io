<h1>Neuroplasticity and Growth Mindset</h1>
<h2>Sprint4 Cultural Blog</h2>

<p>Research Neuroplasticity

I value the understanding of Neuroplasticity as a physical representation of the mind responding to a flexible mindset. This understanding I believe is crucial in 
    when we think of the many negative effects one might face either within a stagnent headspace or being observed by one with this particular headspace. In a world of 
    growing acceptance for difference not just in a persons make up from birth but the ever evolving transitions of life this will have to be a widely accepted scientifical 
    understanding.
 I currently relate to this idea with my predicament as I learn to shift my thought processes to accommodate for this very unique way of thinking in tech. Visualising 
    the neurons making connections with each new lesson is helping to build a physical connection with my learning.

    Growth mindset is one that I gravitate towards as a new parent. The idea that a simple change in approach, in positive engagement and building a healthy relationship
    with failure is hugely encouraging to learn of the huge successes associated with this. 
    I like to think about the kindness we have to apply to our minds, the gentle approach that fosters strength rather then fear and fustration. 

    In my learning I hope to remind myself of the changing nature of learning and the positive complications that come with that.
