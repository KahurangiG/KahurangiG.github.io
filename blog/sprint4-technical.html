<h1>My approach to Problem Solving</h1>
<h2>Sprint4 Technical Blog</h2>

<p>
    The quest to learn a completely new way of thinking of processing information and working through tasks has been nothing short of a difficult task this time around.
    To say that I have struggled has been as times felt like an understatement however in doing so it has revealed a number of difficulties that I face both personally
    and 'professionally'. Theirs nothing like a short and seemingly easy request of you that turns in to a massive self-realisation of ones incapability to humble one
    into diving deep into problem solving processes to figure it all out. A series of REPL. test was exactly this for me, a series of quick tasks that require you
    to think not just in definition of what code is but how to implement it in seriously confusing ways. (One day I hope to look back at this and think, those were
    so easy). 

    So an example of this had to be in developing a stratergy to work out the average of a range of scores listed for for four students. The trick of this was to 
    create a function that would allow me to receive an average for each student at my request simply by calling on this function. 
    
    Okay now working through this was made up of a series of over complicated ways and running off on tangent situations and here is how it all happened. 
    1. For one I wasn't using the console.log efficiently and was therefore not receiving a clear message of how my information was being received.
    This in turn turned out to be a huge complication in the way that I was perceiving the information created and decleared.

    Thanks to the awesome advice that I received this brought an end to this delema.

    Throughout this process I was not only hugely frastrated but a strong feeling of incompetency was present. Confidence = low.
    Ultimately the lesson here for me was to come back to the value of process and understanding that their is huge value in talking and walking through issues with
    others. 
    
    
    Reflect on how confident you feel using the problem solving techniques and process:
    
    Pseudocode although not truly understood at first it has become a sense of comfort in working through problems. It will be forever my native language and as such
    should be utilised in this way to work through problems initially. I imagine that this will be my first step in problem solving moving forward.

    Nothing like a good old fashion trial and error process. This naturally is a step that I continually use with hope that the answer will fall into place 
    Reading error messages is a great guide throughout to atleast locate where issues lie.
    Googling is by far your very best friend at all stages of the adventure. Where would I be without it is a very valid question.
    Nothing however can compare to the careful wording you can learn from your peer or coach and walking through that process in real time with their advice. 
    Finally the true process of truly absorbing information is in the reflection process. A message to yourself in your own langauge that throws back the information 
    that is imbedded in the mind.
